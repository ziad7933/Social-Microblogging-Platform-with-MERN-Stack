# A Simple Microblogging Platform
This is a simple project I did to learn more about REACT and Node.js. The project works completely and does everything starting from creating a user account or logging in with Google and creating liking and deleting posts.

## How to run

To start the project, open the project in VSCode or any other editor of your choice and follow the steps below:

- Open a bash terminal and split it.
- In each of the terminal, navigate to the **server** and **client** folder using the commands ```cd server``` and ```cd client``` in each terminal.
- Type in ```npm start``` in each of the terminal and wait for the project to start running. Once it is up and running, the browser will pop open and redirect you to the localhost where the project is hosted.

## Technologies Used
