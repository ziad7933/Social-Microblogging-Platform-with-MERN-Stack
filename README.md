# An Assessment To Create a MicroBlogging Platform
This is an app created with all the requirements that was asked of. There were certain limitations that I faced and I will be listing them down below.

## How to run

To start the project, open the project in VSCode or any other editor of your choice and follow the steps below:

- Open a bash terminal and split it.
- In each of the terminal, navigate to the **server** and **client** folder using the commands ```cd server``` and ```cd client``` in each terminal.
- Type in ```npm start``` in each of the terminal and wait for the project to start running. Once it is up and running, the browser will pop open and redirect you to the localhost where the project is hosted.

## Issues That I faced in this project
The problems were mostly limitations on the software side and not my inability to do the work.

- I was not familiar with TypeScript so I did not waste any time and used JavaScript.
- I could not use Firebase as preferred by the assessment because the cloud services are now paid by Google and I cannot get the API to work with. Which is why I used MongoDB, created a Cluster and used its database with this project.
- I was not familiar with GraphQL at all. I tried implementing it but it only lead to errors and the whole project crashing down causing me to restart from the beginning.
